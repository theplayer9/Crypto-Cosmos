## üí• Introduction

Crypto Cosmos is a web-based application that displays the latest updates about the top 100 cryptocurrencies like its current price, the percentage change in the last 24 hours, profit, etc. It also shows the behavior of any crypto in chart form, to make it more interactive. One can also search for any crypto and get information about a particular currency. Nice interactive graphs are there which will show you the growth/fall of the currency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech used

It is built using **React JS**, **JavaScript**, **Material UI**, and **Chart JS** with full responsive functionality. I have used _Context API_ to manage the state of our app and **Coin Gecko API** to fetch all the information regarding the currencies. I also used **Particle-js** to give it a unique UI design.

## üí° Why did I build this?

The idea for this project was one of those startup ideas that I had a couple of months ago. When I landed in college in 2020, I and my friends were exploring various tracks. Investing in cryptocurrency was one of them. We have to monitor the behavior of each crypto and also on the market. Being students it was hard for us to invest this much amount of time on just one thing. That's when I decided to make a crypto tracker which will do all the heavy lifting for us and named my project "Crypto Cosmos".

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
