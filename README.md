## üí• Introduction

Crypto Cosmos is a web-based application that displays the latest updates about the top 100 cryptocurrencies like its current price, the percentage change in the last 24 hours, profit, etc. It also shows the behavior of any crypto in chart form, to make it more interactive. One can also search for any crypto and get information about a particular currency. Nice interactive graphs are there which will show you the growth/fall of the currency.

## üí° Why did I build this?

The idea for this project was one of those startup ideas that I had a couple of months ago. When I landed in college in 2020, I and my friends were exploring various tracks. Investing in cryptocurrency was one of them. We have to monitor the behavior of each crypto and also on the market. Being students it was hard for us to invest this much amount of time on just one thing. That's when I decided to make a crypto tracker which will do all the heavy lifting for us and named my project "Crypto Cosmos".

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech used

It is built using **React JS**, **JavaScript**, **Material UI**, and **Chart JS** with full responsive functionality. I have used _Context API_ to manage the state of our app and **Coin Gecko API** to fetch all the information regarding the currencies. I also used **Particle-js** to give it a unique UI design.
